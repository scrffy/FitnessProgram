Bench:

- [WARM UP]

- What a fkn start to Chest day - there's not much better in life than hitting flat-bench first up! 

- Slow and controlled, come down to just above your chest every rep, don't bounce the bar off it but make sure you get full range of motion

- If you're unsure or not confident in yourself as you're just starting out then get someone friendly in the gym to come assist/spot you!

- Typically rep 70kg after a long chest session for 3-4 sets - I'm usually absolutely ruined at this stage of the workout so 4 sets is sometimes beyond me!

Incline DB Press: 

- Now this may seem like a lot going straight from flat bench to incline DB but we're here to annihilate our chest & grow that bitch so let's smash it! 

- Careful with your form picking up heavy dumbbells, I know better than most about annoying back pain caused from the gym

- Bench angle determines where on your chest is activated - the higher up you go (to a certain point then it becomes majoritively shoulders) the more upper chest it works

- If you're happy with where your upper chest is and you'd much rather work your entire chest then scroll down to the 'bench' section and implement dumbbell flat bench here

- Form is crucial here, especially as you increase weight - careful not to go below your shoulder line on the downward part of movement

- I'm currently on 40kg dumbbells for incline press, 6 reps, working my way up to 8 reps gradually!

T-Bar Rows:

- Form form form - don't go too heavy until you've got your form 100% down

- Do not injure your back doing these, be extremely careful and if you have any doubts ask a gym employee for assistance

- For similar reasons to not doing deadlifts my T-bar row weight is not that high - I'm mainly concerned about form so will max out at around two plates

- Currently on 2 20kg plates and one 5 kg plate going for 12 reps per set

Incline Flys:

- Straight into these after Incline DB, make sure you treat the transition as a superset

- Slow and controlled is key, get your arms at the right angle so it's not ripping your shoulders but it's also engaging your chest as much as possible

- Arm angle is also key - don't straight arm it but also don't chest press, find that sweet spot in-between to maximise chest gains while minimising the risk of shoulder injuries

- I'm on 14kg dumbbells for incline flys

Lat Pulldowns:

- Very important to build your complete back and give you WINGS

- Strict form as always, make sure to pull all the way down and engage your lats, don't pull with your arms/biceps

- Squeeze as hard as you can at the bottom for maximum effectiveness

- I like to use the lat pulldown machine at around 65kg currently for 8 reps, working my way up to controlled bodyweight pulldowns

Cables (Up & Down):

(Upward)
- Killer superset, if I'm feeling frisky then I sometimes do a set of 10-15 pushups as a superset to really annihilate the chest

- Position the cables at or slightly above head height

- Position yourself at the centre of the machine, then step forward into the space in front and lock your legs in place

- I'm then looking to find the perfect arm angle (the same angle you used on incline DB flys up above) to maximise chest gains while minimising shoulder injuries

- Lock your arms in place and pull with your chest, squeezing as hard as you can as your hands touch

- I do 12.5kg in downward flys for 10 reps 

(Downward)
- As above, position yourself in the centre of the machine but this time don't step forward

- Legs shoulder width apart, arms similar angle to above

- Stick your chest out and pull up with your chest, activating it the whole way through

- Squeeze at the top, 12 reps minimum and now is when I would superset with pushups if you have it in you!

- I do 10.5kg for 8 reps in this direction

Pull-Ups (Final set to failure!!)

- Final exercise!!! x3 sets of pull ups (preferably non-assisted) but if you require assistance then that's perfectly fine too!

- If you can only do a handful of reps that's totally fine too, keep at it and gradually build yourself up to 8-12 reps

- Here I'm looking to pull up with the lats and back - not with your arms, get your head as high as possible and hold at the top

- As many bodyweight reps as you can for 3 sets!
