Cool-down:

- Go for a well-deserved walk/lap around the park. I like to listen to relaxing music, walk slowly and enjoy mother nature before heading home - well done!!

Swim:

Tips

- Get into a breathing rhythm - breath out for 3 strokes while underwater then breathe in and repeat, rotating your head (breathing) on both sides of your body

- If you don't breathe out all of the air in your lungs while underwater then this leaves space for half as much air to be inhaled on your breath in, it also leaves a build up of waste gases in your lungs making you feel more out of breath. So relax underwater and breath out all the oxygen in your lungs in a slow and controlled manner 
  
- Extended, long arm movement forward, as your palm hits the water sweep your arm backwards and down so your forearm is vertical underwater

- Pull your arm all the way backwards, don't give up on that stroke once your hand passes your face

- Breathe when your arm is 'recovering' out of the water, so quickly rotate your head for a breath as the arm on that side is out of the water

- Look down and slightly forward and kick with your toes pointed!
