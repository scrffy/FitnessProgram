Week 4: Outdoor Jogging

Warm-up:

- Light dynamic stretching (leg swings, arm circles, etc.) for 5-7 minutes while walking
  
Main Workout:

- Jog at a steady pace for 30 minutes.

- At the 10 minute mark, jog slightly faster for 2 minutes (about a 10% increase in speed)

- Recover by relaxing with 1 minute of easy-paced recovery jogging
  
- At the 20 minute mark, repeat the fast jog for 2 minutes with a 1 minut recovery after
   
Cooldown:

- Slow jog or brisk walk for 5 minutes.
  
- Static stretching for major muscle groups (quads, hamstrings, calves, etc.) for 5-7 minutes.

- Aim for a total workout time of 30-45 mins

Alternatives:

HIIT Class:

- [ITEMS REQUIRED]: Water bottle, phone (timer), markers (I use my hat and a water bottle)

- Go to your local park (if weather permits) and do the following:

- Warm-up:

- Light jog around the park (roughly 3-5 mins)

- Bodyweight squats, arm circles, any stretching you want to include

Workout:

- [Place markers 25m apart, do all your exercises at one marker and use the other as your point of reference for sprints]

- I place my water bottle where I am and hat (or other item) at ~25m away

- x10 push-ups

- x10 jump-squats [Normal body weight squats - jump at the top]

- x20 mountain climbers [lie in a plank position and raise your knee to your chest, repeat 20 times (10 per leg) at a rapid pace]

- x1 25m sprint, 25m jog back to starting position

- 45 second rest

REPEAT 3 TIMES

- x10 burpees [basically a push-up superset with a jump-squat]

- x20 body-weight squats

- Lunge 25m (to your reference point)

- Sprint back

- 60 second rest

- REPEAT 3 TIMES

Cool-down:

- Go for a well-deserved walk/lap around the park. I like to listen to relaxing music, walk slowly and enjoy mother nature before heading home - well done!!

600m Swim:

- Again, this is not professional fitness advice it's simply what I typically do for cardio and it works for me!

- I like swimming in particular as it's cardio but still builds and maintains muscle. It hits delts (shoulders), lats (back), traps, tri's & bi's, abs, quads, hamstrings, calves and hip flexors!

- Basically hits your entire body while being amazing for your cardiovascular system too!

This week's swim workout is:

- x4 freestyle lengths (up and back in a 25m pool) without stopping

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 60 second rest

Repeat 3 times

Online Pilates:

- I recommend Move With Nicole on Youtube:

- [MoveWithNicole](https://www.youtube.com/@MoveWithNicole)

- She has great workouts for the whole body, legs, abs, upper body, lower body and stretching - I like to try incorporate minimum one workout per week
