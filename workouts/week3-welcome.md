order: 1

Congratulations on making it this far - 3 weeks in is a great milestone. This week is almost identical to Week 1 - as I've previously mentioned this is on purpose as you need to repeat exercises to see results. The primary difference is the order you do the exercises in - this is to keep things fresh while still ensuring you're doing all the key exercises!

As with previous weeks comprehensive exercise guidance is provided in the Tutorial Video for each workout, additional description is provided in the side bar next to the video.

Week 3 is all about taking Week 1's exercises to the next level. At a minimum I want you guys to be doing 2 extra reps on each of your exercises. If you're punching out 12 reps then I suggest increasing (by at least 2kg) the weight you're repping. Also, take a moment to congratulate yourself and check your progress up to now. I bet you can see results of some kind - if not, no worries they're coming don't you worry! In addition to increasing your physical strength I highly recommend concentrating on your mental game in the gym this week. That means minimising phone time, focussing on the exact body movement during sets rather than letting your mind stray, being punctual on your rest times and ensuring your form is as perfect as it can be.

If your motivation is diminishing for any reason then reach out to either myself, a key person in your life, or anyone in our Telegram Chat (if you're on the subscription service) to share your progress, discuss tips and tricks, adapt your workout strategy (mental or physical) and basically stay on track. Also, again just for those in our Telegram Chat, keep an eye out for one of my Live Workouts where I walk you guys through and actual gym session of mine providing more tips, more tricks and more motivation!!

As previously mentioned feel free to Email me at joshuawpaine@gmail.com - make sure to include FITNESS PROGAM as the subject so I see your email!

You know the drill, let's gym!!
