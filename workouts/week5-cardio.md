Week 5 - 600m Swim:

As you can see in the title this week we're back around to our swim. As always, there are alternatives below if you don't have access to a pool/don't want to swim!

I've kept the swim workout the same. I know how hard swimming is for most (unless you're already an unreal swimmer) so I've decided not to increase the distance. If you found the first week's easy then feel free to add in some more of the slow/power laps! If you found it too hard then contact me directly and we can work on an easy program for you! 

Tips

- Get into a breathing rythmy - breath out for 3 strokes while underwater then breathe in and repeat, rotating your head (breathing) on both sides of your body
  
- Extended, long arm movement forward, as your palm hits the water sweep your arm backwards and down so your forearm is vertical underwater

- Pull your arm all the way backwards, don't give up on that stroke once your hand passes your face

- Look slightly forward and kick with your toes pointed

This week's swim workout is:

- x4 freestyle lengths (up and back in a 25m pool) without stopping

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 60 second rest

- Repeat 3 times

Alternatives:
  
I've listed alternatives below (which will be replacing the swim in following week's cardio sessions) for those of you without lap-pool access.

Online Pilates:

- I recommend Move With Nicole on Youtube:

- [MoveWithNicole](https://www.youtube.com/@MoveWithNicole)

She has great workouts for the whole body, legs, abs, upper body, lower body and stretching - I like to try incorporate minimum one workout per week

Fitness Class:

- Highly recommend Barry's Bootcamp - if there's one near you and within your budget then get in touch and see what they have to offer you!

- If not, then your local gym probably offers similar classes - enquire as you see fit as they're an awesome cardio workout!

HIIT Workout:

[ITEMS REQUIRED]: Water bottle, phone (timer), markers (I use my hat and a water bottle)

Go to your local park (if weather permits) and do the following:

Warm-up:

- Light jog around the park (roughly 3-5 mins)

- Bodyweight squats, arm circles, any stretching you want to include

Workout:

- [Place markers 25m apart, do all your exercises at one marker and use the other as your point of reference for sprints]

- I place my water bottle where I am and hat (or other item) at ~25m away

- x10 push-ups

- x10 jump-squats [Normal body weight squats - jump at the top]

- x20 mountain climbers [lie in a plank position and raise your knee to your chest, repeat 20 times (10 per leg) at a rapid pace]

- x1 25m sprint, 25m jog back to starting position

- 45 second rest

REPEAT 3 TIMES

- x10 burpees [basically a push-up superset with a jump-squat]

- x20 body-weight squats

- Lunge 25m (to your reference point)

- Sprint back
  
- 60 second rest

REPEAT 3 TIMES

Cool-down:

- Go for a well-deserved walk/lap around the park. I like to listen to relaxing music, walk slowly and enjoy mother nature before heading home - well done!!
