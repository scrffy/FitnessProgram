Week 5 - Swim:

As you can see in the title this week we're back around to our swim. As always, there are alternatives below if you don't have access to a pool/don't want to swim!

If you're swimming this week then I want you to think back to Week 1. How hard was the workout that you chose? If you went easy was it too easy? If you went intermediate was it to easy? If so, I want you to push yourself and do the harder version of the workout (if possible). If you found the easy one hard then that's fine, it takes a while to build up your swimming stamina. As long as you're doing your best to push your body and get your heart rate up then I'm both happy for you and proud of you! 

- Again, this is not professional fitness advice it's simply what I typically do for cardio and it works for me! An obvious disclaimer is that if you are not a confident swimmer, or can't swim, then please do one of the alternative workouts provided. I would personally classify a confident swimmer as someone who can swim freestyle for 100m without stopping.

- As with week 1, I've provided 3 different swimming workouts (easy, intermediate and hard). Feel free to choose which ever will be good for you. If you've never swam for fitness before then please start with the easy workout and work your way up to more difficult ones as the program progresses (as you repeat it). If you're a strong swimmer then please proceed with either the intermediate or hard workout!! 


Tips

- Get into a breathing rythmy - breath out for 3 strokes while underwater then breathe in and repeat, rotating your head (breathing) on both sides of your body
  
- Extended, long arm movement forward, as your palm hits the water sweep your arm backwards and down so your forearm is vertical underwater

- Pull your arm all the way backwards, don't give up on that stroke once your hand passes your face

- Breathe when your arm is 'recovering' out of the water, so quickly rotate your head for a breath as the arm on that side is out of the water

- Look down and slightly forward and kick with your toes pointed!

Alternatives:
  
I've listed alternatives below (which will be replacing the swim in following week's cardio sessions) for those of you without lap-pool access.

Online Pilates:

- I recommend Move With Nicole on Youtube:

- [MoveWithNicole](https://www.youtube.com/@MoveWithNicole)

She has great workouts for the whole body, legs, abs, upper body, lower body and stretching - I like to try incorporate minimum one workout per week

Fitness Class:

- Highly recommend Barry's Bootcamp - if there's one near you and within your budget then get in touch and see what they have to offer you!

- If not, then your local gym probably offers similar classes - enquire as you see fit as they're an awesome cardio workout!

HIIT Workout:

[ITEMS REQUIRED]: Water bottle, phone (timer), markers (I use my hat and a water bottle)

Go to your local park (if weather permits) and do the following:

Warm-up:

- Light jog around the park (roughly 3-5 mins)

- Bodyweight squats, arm circles, any stretching you want to include

Workout:

- [Place markers 25m apart, do all your exercises at one marker and use the other as your point of reference for sprints]

- I place my water bottle where I am and hat (or other item) at ~25m away

- x10 push-ups

- x10 jump-squats [Normal body weight squats - jump at the top]

- x20 mountain climbers [lie in a plank position and raise your knee to your chest, repeat 20 times (10 per leg) at a rapid pace]

Cool-down:
