**Chest & Back**
Day two!!!!! You got this babyy. As with Day 1, start by watching and listening to the tutorial videos carefully. I explain everything I'm thinking/doing during the actual set which I find helps tremendously.

I'm using this program to fill out my Chest & Back. I love the look of a full chest and a naturally great back that looks good when you're walking around shirtless without tensing - so that's what this day is designed to achieve. Again, I like to keep the workouts high intensity - so short and sweet (warning, our pump today is gunna be outrageously good). As previously mentioned, I'd love to be deadlifting today but unfortunately can't - feel free to sub one back exercise out for deads if you love them!

**Incline DB**
Heavily influenced incline chest routine as I have always felt my lower chest grows faster than my upper - thus I like to focus on my upper and really go for that full look

Careful with your form picking up heavy dumbbells, I know better than most about annoying back pain caused from the gym

Bench angle determines where on your chest is activated - the higher up you go (to a certain point then it becomes majoritively shoulders) the more upper chest it works

If you're happy with where your upper chest is and you'd much rather work your entire chest then scroll down to the 'bench' section and implement dumbbell flat bench here

Form is crucial here, especially as you increase weight - careful not to go below your shoulder line on the downward part of movement

I'm currently on 40kg dumbbells for incline press, 6 reps, working my way up to 8 reps gradually!

**Incline Flys**
Straight into these after Incline DB, make sure you treat the transition as a superset

Slow and controlled is key, get your arms at the right angle so it's not ripping your shoulders but it's also engaging your chest as much as possible

Arm angle is also key - don't straight arm it but also don't chest press, find that sweet spot in-between to maximise chest gains while minimising the risk of shoulder injuries

I'm on 14kg dumbbells for incline flys

**TBar Rows**
Form form form - don't go too heavy until you've got your form 100% down

Do not injure your back doing these, be extremely careful and if you have any doubts ask a gym employee for assistance

For similar reasons to not doing deadlifts my T-bar row weight is not that high - I'm mainly concerned about form so will max out at around two plates

Currently on 2 20kg plates and one 5 kg plate going for 12 reps per set

**Cables (up & down)**
(Upward)
Killer superset, if I'm feeling frisky then I sometimes do a set of 10-15 pushups as a superset to really annihilate the chest

Position the cables at or slightly above head height

Position yourself at the centre of the machine, then step forward into the space in front and lock your legs in place

I'm then looking to find the perfect arm angle (the same angle you used on incline DB flys up above) to maximise chest gains while minimising shoulder injuries

Lock your arms in place and pull with your chest, squeezing as hard as you can as your hands touch

I do 12.5kg in downward flys for 10 reps 

(Downward)
As above, position yourself in the centre of the machine but this time don't step forward

Legs shoulder width apart, arms similar angle to above

Stick your chest out and pull up with your chest, activating it the whole way through

Squeeze at the top, 12 reps minimum and now is when I would superset with pushups if you have it in you!

I do 10.5kg for 8 reps in this direction

**Lat Pulldowns**
Very important to build your complete back and give you WINGS

Strict form as always, make sure to pull all the way down and engage your lats, don't pull with your arms/biceps

Squeeze as hard as you can at the bottom for maximum effectiveness

I like to use the lat pulldown machine at around 65kg currently for 8 reps, working my way up to controlled bodyweight pulldowns

**Bench**
Just when you think you're done for the day I hit you with flat bench press

Slow and controlled, come down to just above your chest every rep, don't bounce the bar off it but make sure you get full range of motion

If you're unsure or not confident in yourself as you're just starting out then get someone friendly in the gym to come assist/spot you!

Typically rep 70kg after a long chest session for 3-4 sets - I'm usually absolutely ruined at this stage of the workout so 4 sets is sometimes beyond me!

**Pull ups - last with final set being to failure**
Final exercise!!! x3 sets of pull ups (preferably non-assisted) but if you require assistance then that's perfectly fine too!

If you can only do a handful of reps that's totally fine too, keep at it and gradually build yourself up to 8-12 reps

Here I'm looking to pull up with the lats and back - not with your arms, get your head as high as possible and hold at the top

As many bodyweight reps as you can for 3 sets!
