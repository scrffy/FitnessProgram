# Welcome - Week 1
WELCOME!!!! Thanks for making the amazing decision to buy my first fitness program. The main thing I need to warn all you guys of is that this is not professional fitness advice, I don't have any personal training/fitness instructor courses under my belt - this is simply my best advice based entirely off what has worked for me for multiple years now. Also, I have a pretty bad lower back, it pops out nearly every single time I do any kind of weighted squats or any deadlifts heavier than ~20kg so therefore I've adapted my regime to not include either of those exercises, and to be extremely careful with my form on particular back exercises/when picking up heavy weights. The majority of you won't have such a problem so feel free to add in squats & deadlifts as you see fit on their respective days.

This program is designed specifically for lean muscle gain. The number of Reps I do are for muslce gain, while the cardio day along with multiple ab routines per week are input to stay lean. This is not a bulking program nor a cutting program. The overall program duration is 8 weeks - every week has similar fundamental movements as these are key to overall grains - the weekly splits are different only via the minor, targeted exercises. It's also worth noting that, where possible (i.e. incline bench) I offer the option to swap out the exercise for a similar one that targets a different portion of the same muslce group (i.e. swapping incline bench for decline bench). This swap is entirely up to you and your goals! Week 1 is repeated in week 3, 5 and 7. Week 2 is repeated in weeks 4, 6 and 8.

Now, compared to other training programs you'll notice some things a bit different! My splits are somewhat unusual: Arms, Chest & Back, Legs, Shoulders and Cardio. I'd much rather spend less time in the actual gym than more - I like short, high intensity workouts - you leave the gym sweating and feeling great, and it's only taken up 45 minutes to 1 hr of your time - how good's that. Nearly my entire arms workout is superset which is mainly due to the pump you get, but secondarily it's for the aforementioned reasons. I love grouping Chest & Back together - it's our longest day in the gym of the week but trust me, it's fkn worth it. My Abs routine is not included in this program as it is it's own beast - it deserves to be separate - see 'ABS - WORKOUT BLASTER' on my linktree to purchase - or if you were a smart cookie you grabbed it as part of a bundle offer with this program and now you're all set to become a fkn machine. Lastly, we explore Carido/extra options on our final day (boo) - however this can be extremely fun. Some weeks I do a fitness class, other weeks I do a pilates class in the back yard and some weeks I swim - I'm not cardio's biggest fan but I appreciate what it does to the body. Also, I mix and match my routine days as I see fit. Some days I get to gym and there's no way I feel like doing Legs so I'll swap it out and do it the next day - just remember to always cover all the splits over the course of a week.

Comprehensive exercise guidance is provided in the Tutorial Video for each workout, additional description is provided in the side bar next to the video.

Diet:

- You'll notice I don't have any dietary advice in this workout program

- Firstly, I need to address the importance of diet. The old gym saying is gains are made in the kitchen, not in the gym. Basically that you need to give just as much time, energy and effort in to eating correctly as you put into the exercise itself

- Personally, I don't adhere to the strictest diet. Yes, I barely eat fast food and love to cook at the house but chocolate and snacks are unfortunately my downfall so I'm not in a position to give the best dietary advice

- Also, I'm not all that knowledgable about fitness diets, I much prefer sticking to what I know and love (the gym) and letting you guys individually maintain your diets

- I would highly recommend consulting a dietary professional if you're looking at improving that area of your fitness, especially if you're looking to lose copious amounts of weight

- Also, ChatGPT has an amazing dietary recommendation capability - it will be very generic advice but it's better than a lot of stuff you'll find on the internet

- However, remember that every one is different - someone looking to put on ridiculous amounts of muscle will obviously have a completely different diet to those of you looking to cut down

- As mentioned consult a professional first but I'm always an email[INSTA DM] away if you'd like a general chat about such things!

Weight Recommendations:

- The framework I've found best over the years is starting with a weight you can barely hit 8 reps with, then stay on that weight til you're COMFORTABLY getting 10 reps, then increase weight so you barely hit 8 reps again, stay on them til you hit 10 and repeat repeat repeat!

- This framework is to be applied only once you've got your form near-perfect in every exercise. Don't hurt yourself with poor form - it will completely hinder your workout career

Terminology:

- Rep: Repitition, means one single up/down/forward/back movement (1 bicep curl is 1 rep)

- Set: Means a group of reps, typically I will ask for anywhere from 8-12 reps done every set 3-4 times. This will be labelled as "8 reps, 4 sets"

- Failure: Keep going until you can't do another rep - push your muscles to the point of failure

- Superset: Means combining multiple exercises into one set - you finish 8 reps of one exercise then immediately start the next, only once you've finished all exercises do you get a rest. For example, a "21s superset" would include bicep curls, tricep extensions and close grip bench so 3 exercises in total

- Drop-set: Start at your normal weight and do 8 reps, then lower the weight (if on a pulley system, drop the weight by 2 pegs) and do 10 reps, drop another 2 pegs and do 12 reps, drop another 2 and go to failure!

- Negatives: The part of each movement where you're not applying force/working - so for a bicep curl the negative is the way back down, from the top, to your starting position

Tips:

- WARM UP: Warm-up tutorial videos are given below. Follow the corresponding video depending on which body area you're focussing on

- Motivation is the key to success and there are plenty of methods for maintaining yours:

- Progress photos: Advised to be taken at the start of your journey (this program) to be looked back on to see just how far you've come

- Stick to this program as consistently as you can. I find my motivation peaks after 2-3 days of consistent training. So, if I've been on holiday or haven't been able to gym I force myself to go 3 days in a row & my motivation returns

- Track your progress - this, similarly to Progress Pics, is a great way to see how far you've come and how far you've still got to go

- Exercise with a gym buddy if you can - it's so much easier to let yourself down (by not going gym) than to let your gym buddy down - also, you don't wanna get left behind ;)

- Workout with noise cancelling headphones if you can! It makes me way more focussed and blocks out all the gym background noise

- I like to go to the gym at times that aren't busiest, however I understand not everyone can do this so go when suits you but if you have the option go for the empty gym!

- Inhale on your Negatives, exhale on the 'working' part of exercise - See all my tutorial videos for examples - I've clearly exhaled on the correct section to demonstrate this

- For the ultimate body & mind workout try reading while walking/commuting to and from the gym. It's about a 7 minute walk from my place so can get in a good few pages. It makes me leave feeling completely fresh having had minimal screen time and also done something great for both my body and mind.

- Jot down your weights for each exercise in notes on your phone so you have it handy for your next session!

Try all these tips and let me know how you go!

Finally, if you need help understanding anything, want my assistance or personalised advice then feel free to message me on Instagram. Make sure to include FITNESS PROGRAM as the first two words so I see your DM!

Ok - now the boring stuff's out of the way - let's gym!!


# Warm-Ups
 Warming up is one of the most important parts of working out. It prevents injury and ensures you will be able to work out for many years to come.

With upper body, I find the most crucial warm up to be your rotator cuff exercises.

Your rotator cuff is a group of muslces and tendons in your shoulders that allow your shoulders to rotate.

It is fundamental for nearly all upper body exercises - healthy shoulders are so important for a long and prosperous gym career

Stretching is a requirement regardless of the day you're doing - obviously you'll be stretching different muscles for different days at the gym.

Please follow the tutorial videos given below:
