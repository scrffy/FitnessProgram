Fantastic progress! You've reached Week 7, and I'm thrilled to see your dedication and hard work throughout this fitness journey.

As promised, Week 7 follows a similar structure to Weeks 3 and 5 but with some exciting modifications. Congratulations on making it this far; you're well on your way to achieving your fitness goals!

Now, it's time to elevate your game even further. In Week 7, we're pushing the boundaries and taking things up a notch. You've already mastered the exercises from Weeks 1-6, and now it's time to challenge yourself with increased intensity and heavier weights. Remember, gym results are achieved through repetition and consistency. By repeating these exercises with dedication, you'll witness remarkable progress and the transformation you've been working towards.

I've been following a routine similar to this 8-week program for nearly my entire gym career, and it's been the key to my success for about seven years. While it's essential to switch things up occasionally, [being part of my subscription program allows you the flexibility to adapt the routine as needed. No matter where you are in the world, you'll have the opportunity to work out with me, and that's pretty amazing!] ADAPT THIS FOR OTP PEOPLE

As we venture through this journey together, keep your motivation high by focusing on the results you'll achieve. Real results are the ultimate driving force. Witnessing your gains and progress will undoubtedly change your perspective on the gym experience. There's nothing quite like that empowering feeling after a challenging chest and back day, looking at yourself in the mirror and seeing the improvements you've made.

Now, let's dive into Week 7 with enthusiasm and determination. You've become familiar with the exercises, and you've honed your technique. It's time to increase the weights, fine-tune your form, concentrate on the mind-muscle connection during both the negative and positive phases of each movement, and, of course, maintain a balanced diet and proper sleep.

This week, we're going to train FKN HARD! Let's make every workout count, pushing our limits and striving for greatness. Your progress so far has been remarkable, and I have no doubt that Week 7 will be no exception. You've got this, and I'm right here cheering you on every step of the way!

Let's crush Week 7 together and make it the best one yet. See you at the gym.
