title: "Cardio & Extras"
order: 1
week: 1

Well here we are, the end of the week and some people's worst enemy. Don't worry, we're in this boat together - I'm not a fan of MOST versions of cardio. I can tolerate ones that are social, fitness mixed in with an activity, a sport etc.

Firstly I would highly recommend signing up to a local sports team, maybe indoor soccer, basketball or local touch rugby team. These are essentially 'free' cardio because it requires minimal motivation on your end, much less than trying to convince yourself to go on a 30 minute run.

If this isn't possible or it's not your thing I would then say sign up to a local lap pool. It's insanely good for every part of you - breathing, heart-rate, muscle definition, muscle building, weight loss - you name it. Also, for someone who's weary about knee health in old age like myself it's much less taxing on your bones/body than running on concrete for an hour.

Fitness classes are next on my list. Recently, I've been attending Barry's Bootcamp classes here and there and they're insanely good. Like I said with playing sport, it's essentially a 'free' workout because you don't have to motivate yourself (you have a professional trainer yelling at you through a mic for that exact reason!!). If you've signed up/have access to a fitness class then you can sub out the 'Outdoor Jogging' sessions with Fitness Class sessions instead! However, I understand these aren't possible for some people for a variety of reasons hence this is only an option!

Not cardio related but definitely classified as 'other' or 'non-gym'. Recently I've been doing 30-45 minute Pilates classes once/twice a week on Youtube. I find this great for a switch up from my normal routine, also it's fantastic for flexibility, muscle tone (particularly core muscles), muscular control etc - the list goes on!

Hiking and walking aren't as strenuous but are certainly good for the health, and your mental health.

A great addition is also a HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) park workout. You get to work out outside, ramp up your heart rate and burn body fat all while in a beautiful park/location!

As the weeks progress we will explore all these options together - how exciting!

On Cardio day I'm going to make suggestions based on what I do but I completely understand that not everyone has the same access to facilities as I do (swimming pool, fitness classes etc). Thus, unlike the other days of the program, you do not need to follow this section exactly. If you don't like swimming or aren't signed up to a pool, or if you don't want to fork out money for a fitness class then you don't have to - there are plenty of alternative options available (as listed above). Something as simple as a 30 minute run or long hike with friends will do the same trick (depending on your fitness goals).

Week 1: Swim

Tips

- Get into a breathing rhythm - breath out for 3 strokes while underwater then breathe in and repeat, rotating your head (breathing) on both sides of your body

- If you don't breathe out all of the air in your lungs while underwater then this leaves space for half as much air to be inhaled on your breath in, it also leaves a build up of waste gases in your lungs making you feel more out of breath. So relax underwater and breath out all the oxygen in your lungs in a slow and controlled manner 
  
- Extended, long arm movement forward, as your palm hits the water sweep your arm backwards and down so your forearm is vertical underwater

- Pull your arm all the way backwards, don't give up on that stroke once your hand passes your face

- Breathe when your arm is 'recovering' out of the water, so quickly rotate your head for a breath as the arm on that side is out of the water

- Look down and slightly forward and kick with your toes pointed!

I've listed alternatives below (which will be replacing the swim in following week's cardio sessions) for those of you without lap-pool access.

Online Pilates:

- I recommend Move With Nicole on Youtube:

- [MoveWithNicole](https://www.youtube.com/@MoveWithNicole)

She has great workouts for the whole body, legs, abs, upper body, lower body and stretching - I like to try incorporate minimum one workout per week

Outdoor Jogging:

Warm-up:

- Light dynamic stretching (leg swings, arm circles, etc.) for 5-7 minutes while walking
  
Main Workout:

- Jog at a steady pace for 30 minutes.

- At the 10 minute mark, jog slightly faster for 2 minutes (about a 10% increase in speed)

- Recover by relaxing with 1 minute of easy-paced recovery jogging
  
- At the 20 minute mark, repeat the fast jog for 2 minutes with a 1 minut recovery after
   
Cooldown:

- Slow jog or brisk walk for 5 minutes.
  
- Static stretching for major muscle groups (quads, hamstrings, calves, etc.) for 5-7 minutes.

- Aim for a total workout time of 30-45 mins

HIIT Workout:

[ITEMS REQUIRED]: Water bottle, phone (timer), markers (I use my hat and a water bottle)

Go to your local park (if weather permits) and do the following:

Warm-up:

- Light jog around the park (roughly 3-5 mins)

- Bodyweight squats, arm circles, any stretching you want to include

Workout:

- [Place markers 25m apart, do all your exercises at one marker and use the other as your point of reference for sprints]

- x10 push-ups

- x10 jump-squats [Normal body weight squats - jump at the top]

Cool-down:

- Go for a well-deserved walk/lap around the park. I like to listen to relaxing music, walk slowly and enjoy mother nature before heading home - well done!!
