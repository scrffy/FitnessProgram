Week 7 - 800m Swim:

Aaaaaand we're back in the pool! As you can see in the title I've increased our laps here - added 200m for good measure ;)

Try your best to complete the entire swim, if you can't then no worries - stay at 600m and work your way up as you repeat the program!! 

Tips

- Get into a breathing rythmy - breath out for 3 strokes while underwater then breathe in and repeat, rotating your head (breathing) on both sides of your body
  
- Extended, long arm movement forward, as your palm hits the water sweep your arm backwards and down so your forearm is vertical underwater

- Pull your arm all the way backwards, don't give up on that stroke once your hand passes your face

- Look slightly forward and kick with your toes pointed

This week's swim workout is:

- x4 freestyle lengths (up and back in a 25m pool) without stopping

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 60 second rest

- Repeat 4 times

Alternatives:
  
I've listed alternatives below (which will be replacing the swim in following week's cardio sessions) for those of you without lap-pool access.

Online Pilates:

- I recommend Move With Nicole on Youtube:

- [MoveWithNicole](https://www.youtube.com/@MoveWithNicole)

She has great workouts for the whole body, legs, abs, upper body, lower body and stretching - I like to try incorporate minimum one workout per week

Outdoor Jogging:

Warm-up:

- Light dynamic stretching (leg swings, arm circles, etc.) for 5-7 minutes while walking
  
Main Workout:

- Jog at a steady pace for 30 minutes.

- At the 10 minute mark, jog slightly faster for 2 minutes (about a 10% increase in speed)

- Recover by relaxing with 1 minute of easy-paced recovery jogging
  
- At the 20 minute mark, repeat the fast jog for 2 minutes with a 1 minut recovery after
   
Cooldown:

- Slow jog or brisk walk for 5 minutes.
  
- Static stretching for major muscle groups (quads, hamstrings, calves, etc.) for 5-7 minutes.

- Aim for a total workout time of 30-45 mins


HIIT Workout:

[ITEMS REQUIRED]: Water bottle, phone (timer), markers (I use my hat and a water bottle)

Go to your local park (if weather permits) and do the following:

Warm-up:

- Light jog around the park (roughly 3-5 mins)

- Bodyweight squats, arm circles, any stretching you want to include

Workout:

- [Place markers 25m apart, do all your exercises at one marker and use the other as your point of reference for sprints]

- I place my water bottle where I am and hat (or other item) at ~25m away

- x10 push-ups

- x10 jump-squats [Normal body weight squats - jump at the top]

- x20 mountain climbers [lie in a plank position and raise your knee to your chest, repeat 20 times (10 per leg) at a rapid pace]

- x1 25m sprint, 25m jog back to starting position

- 45 second rest

REPEAT 3 TIMES

- x10 burpees [basically a push-up superset with a jump-squat]

- x20 body-weight squats

- Lunge 25m (to your reference point)

- Sprint back

REPEAT 3 TIMES

Cool-down:

- Go for a well-deserved walk/lap around the park. I like to listen to relaxing music, walk slowly and enjoy mother nature before heading home - well done!!
