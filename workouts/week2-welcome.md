WEEK 2 BABYYYY let's get it!

Congratulations on making it through Week 1 - I hope it was everything you wanted and more. Also, I hope you're just as excited as me for week 2. As I'm sure you'll realise there are exercises that overlap with week 1. This is done on purpose and is not laziness on my end. You need your main exercises (bench, deadlifts, squats, shoulder press, 21's superset) to grow in the gym and every gym-goer will tell you how essential it is that you incorporate these into your weekly split.

As with Week 1 comprehensive exercise guidance is provided in the Tutorial Video for each workout, additional description is provided in the side bar next to the video.

Week 2 is an essential motivation week. I understand that some days may be tougher than others - and a lot of people find these tough days popping up during the second week of consecutive training. You've given the first week everything you've got and now it's time to restart. On such days, remember why you started, why you purchased this program. Remember your fitness goals and go one step further - visualise the version of yourself you're training to become. Also, keep in mind that you're not alone in this journey. Reach out to me at any time, especially when you're feeling unmotivated. Also, take care of yourself inside and outside of the gym. Get enough rest, fuel your body with nutritious food and stay hydrated. All these factors play important roles in your fitness journey as they ensure longevity.

Arms: 

- This week's arm day is similar to last week's with minor modifications. We're still targeting bi's and tri's but this time we're including isolated single arm preacher curls as well as single arm tricep extensions. The preachers are amazing for increasing specifically your bicep height and thus arm size, while the single arm extensions target that outer (and most visible) tricep head. 

- Try increase (even by the smallest amount) the weight you did last week for the core movements. I understand it may be too early but perhaps your form is better this time round and the movements feel more natural. If so, chuck some hype music on and bump that shit up!!!! 

- Chest & Back: This week's chest and back session has more focus on your upper back via doing double rows (one T-bar exercise and one machine exercise). Chest is also burnt out by the amazing flat DB press superset which absolutely annihilates your pecs. Considering we're one week further into our journey I would be expecting either a slight weight increase (if you've mastered the form of each exercise) or if you're staying at the same weight then pushing for +2 reps on all exercises.

Legs: 

- Week 2 leg day - time to throw on some size. Legs are such an important muscle group and have amazing fundamental exercises that do need to be repeated. Remember, if you're following my program exactly then proceed with the lunges and bodyweight squats superset - if you are comfortable squatting with weight then sub out my lunges routine and add in squats instead - this is completely up to you and your ability! 

Shoulders: 

- Compared to Week 1 shoulders we're including a couple of different exercise variations. One of them being seated Smith Machine press - which is one of my long-term favourite shoulder exercises. It's so good to do at the end of your session because of the rigidness of the Smith Machines movement it isolates and really targets your front shoulder head - giving you a fkn massive pump and unreal burn. 

Cardio: 

- My cardio recommendations don't change week to week - you just need to hold yourself accountable and make sure you're completeing SOME form of cardio. I don't mind how you choose to do so, it could be a hike with friends, the stair machine at the gym, laps of a pool or a local sport - it's entirely up to you. 

- Last week we focussed on swimming, this week the main event is a park (or similar environment) HIIT workout. I understand that some of you may have done this workout last week as you opted for it instead of the swim. If so, feel free to switch it up (to one of the listed alternatives below) or to repeat the same workout. There's certainly no harm in doing the same HIIT workout twice - its list of benefits are endless so go for gold!!!

- Unlike last week none of you should have a valid excuse to skip this one ;)

Ok - now the boring stuff's out of the way - let's gym!!

Warm Ups:

Warming up is one of the most important parts of working out. It prevents injury and ensures you will be able to work out for many years to come.

With upper body, I find the most crucial warm up to be your rotator cuff exercises.

Your rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons in your shoulders that allow your shoulders to rotate.

It is fundamental for nearly all upper body exercises - healthy shoulders are so important for a long and prosperous gym career

Stretching is a requirement regardless of the day you're doing - obviously you'll be stretching different muscles for different days at the gym.
