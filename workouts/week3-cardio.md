On Cardio day I'm going to make suggestions based on what I do but I completely understand that not everyone has the same access to facilities as I do (swimming pool, fitness classes etc). Thus, unlike the other days of the program, you do not need to follow this section exactly. If you don't like swimming or aren't signed up to a pool, or if you don't want to fork out money for a fitness class then you don't have to - there are plenty of alternative options available (as listed above). Something as simple as a 30 minute run or long hike with friends will do the same trick (depending on your fitness goals). 

Week 3's Day 5 is centred around Pilates! It has countless benefits and you leave each session feeling absolutely amazing. The lady I use (who I've linked below) has endless workouts to choose from each targeting a specific body part (some whole body workouts are great too). Enjoy!

Week 3: Online Pilates Class

- I recommend Move With Nicole on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@MoveWithNicole

- She has great workouts for the whole body, legs, abs, upper body, lower body and stretching - I like to try incorporate minimum one workout per week

- I've opted to not include a guided Pilates workout, written by myself, for you guys

- This is because I'm not experienced enough in Pilates/Yoga world to give sound advice, thus will be suggesting you guys do one of the many online workouts available on Youtube!
  
- If you're not a fan of Pilates or are feeling something different this week then I've outlined alternatives below! Let me know how you go!

- Again, this is not professional fitness advice it's simply what I typically do for cardio and it works for me!

Alternatives: 
  
I've listed alternatives below (which will be replacing the swim in following week's cardio sessions) for those of you without lap-pool access.

Swim:

Tips

- Get into a breathing rhythm - breath out for 3 strokes while underwater then breathe in and repeat, rotating your head (breathing) on both sides of your body

- If you don't breathe out all of the air in your lungs while underwater then this leaves space for half as much air to be inhaled on your breath in, it also leaves a build up of waste gases in your lungs making you feel more out of breath. So relax underwater and breath out all the oxygen in your lungs in a slow and controlled manner 
  
- Extended, long arm movement forward, as your palm hits the water sweep your arm backwards and down so your forearm is vertical underwater

- Pull your arm all the way backwards, don't give up on that stroke once your hand passes your face

- Breathe when your arm is 'recovering' out of the water, so quickly rotate your head for a breath as the arm on that side is out of the water

- Look down and slightly forward and kick with your toes pointed!
