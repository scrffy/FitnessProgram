title: "Week 3 - Cardio & Extras"
order: 1
---
On Cardio day I'm going to make suggestions based on what I do but I completely understand that not everyone has the same access to facilities as I do (swimming pool, fitness classes etc). Thus, unlike the other days of the program, you do not need to follow this section exactly. If you don't like swimming or aren't signed up to a pool, or if you don't want to fork out money for a fitness class then you don't have to - there are plenty of alternative options available (as listed above). Something as simple as a 30 minute run or long hike with friends will do the same trick (depending on your fitness goals). 

Week 3's Day 5 is centred around Pilates! It has countless benefits and you leave each session feeling absolutely amazing. The lady I use (who I've linked below) has endless workouts to choose from each targeting a specific body part (some whole body workouts are great too). Enjoy!

Week 3: Online Pilates Class

- I recommend Move With Nicole on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@MoveWithNicole

- She has great workouts for the whole body, legs, abs, upper body, lower body and stretching - I like to try incorporate minimum one workout per week

- I've opted to not include a guided Pilates workout, written by myself, for you guys

- This is because I'm not experienced enough in Pilates/Yoga world to give sound advice, thus will be suggesting you guys do one of the many online workouts available on Youtube!
  
- If you're not a fan of Pilates or are feeling something different this week then I've outlined alternatives below! Let me know how you go. ![image](https://github.com/scrffy/FitnessProgram/assets/101162903/ea4c6ce0-d0ca-4db1-9fde-bfaad6a557d4)

- Again, this is not professional fitness advice it's simply what I typically do for cardio and it works for me!

Alternatives:
  
I've listed alternatives below (which will be replacing the swim in following week's cardio sessions) for those of you without lap-pool access.

600m swim:

Tips

- Get into a breathing rythmy - breath out for 3 strokes while underwater then breathe in and repeat, rotating your head (breathing) on both sides of your body
  
- Extended, long arm movement forward, as your palm hits the water sweep your arm backwards and down so your forearm is vertical underwater

- Pull your arm all the way backwards, don't give up on that stroke once your hand passes your face

- Look slightly forward and kick with your toes pointed

This week's swim workout is:

- x4 freestyle lengths (up and back in a 25m pool) without stopping

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 60 second rest

- Repeat 3 times

HIIT Workout:

[ITEMS REQUIRED]: Water bottle, phone (timer), markers (I use my hat and a water bottle)

Go to your local park (if weather permits) and do the following:

Warm-up:

- Light jog around the park (roughly 3-5 mins)

- Bodyweight squats, arm circles, any stretching you want to include

Workout:

- [Place markers 25m apart, do all your exercises at one marker and use the other as your point of reference for sprints]

- I place my water bottle where I am and hat (or other item) at ~25m away

- x10 push-ups

- x10 jump-squats [Normal body weight squats - jump at the top]

- x20 mountain climbers [lie in a plank position and raise your knee to your chest, repeat 20 times (10 per leg) at a rapid pace]

- x1 25m sprint, 25m jog back to starting position

- 45 second rest

REPEAT 3 TIMES

- x10 burpees [basically a push-up superset with a jump-squat]

- x20 body-weight squats

- Lunge 25m (to your reference point)

- Sprint back
  
- 60 second rest

REPEAT 3 TIMES

Cool-down:

- Go for a well-deserved walk/lap around the park. I like to listen to relaxing music, walk slowly and enjoy mother nature before heading home - well done!!
