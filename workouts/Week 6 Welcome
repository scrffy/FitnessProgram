Week 6, Let's get it!

Congratulations on conquering Week 5 and reaching this pivotal point in your fitness journey. As we head into Week 6, I'm thrilled by your dedication and progress thus far. This week, you'll notice that some exercises overlap with Week 5, and that's intentional - these core exercises are fundamental to your growth in the gym.

As you've experienced the power of these main exercises (bench, deadlifts, squats, shoulder press, 21's superset), you'll understand just how crucial they are for your overall development. Trust me, incorporating them into your weekly split will yield incredible results over time.

Just like in Week 5, you'll find comprehensive exercise guidance in the Tutorial Videos for each workout. I've also provided additional descriptions in the sidebars next to the videos to ensure you have all the necessary information for a successful session.

Week 6 is a pivotal moment for motivation. I understand that some days can be tougher than others, especially during consecutive weeks of training. But this is where your mental strength shines. Remember your purpose, why you embarked on this fitness journey, and why you invested in this program. Visualise the version of yourself you're striving to become, and let that vision drive you.

You're not alone in this journey. Reach out to me anytime, especially when you need that extra boost of motivation. I'm here to support and guide you every step of the way. Also, remember the importance of self-care inside and outside of the gym. Rest, nourish your body with nutritious food, and stay hydrated - all these factors contribute significantly to your long-term success.

As always, feel free to email me at joshuawpaine@gmail.com - just include FITNESS PROGRAM as the subject, and I'll be sure to respond promptly.

Alright, now let's set aside the boring stuff - it's time to hit the gym!!
