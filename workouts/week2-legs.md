Lunges (SS Free-weight squads):

(Lunges)
- Warm-up set with body weight then straight into it

- Don't over-stride - keep stride length reasonable so you're not over extending, losing balance

- Shoulders back, vertical torso - core engaged, knee directly over ankle with majority of your weight in your front foot

- Superset with bodyweight squats (mainly so I can still incorporate squats and reap some of their benefits)

- I like to do ~14kg each arm, 10 reps each leg

(Free-weight squats)
- Feet shoulder width apart, bend your hips and knees simultaneously

- Lean back into the squat - hinging at the hips, keep your back neutral and core engaged

- I do bodyweight sets here as my lower back is injured!

Leg Press Superset Calf Raises:

- Back rest position is once again key - I like to have it configured so, when resting on the press, my legs are slightly bent (as in the video)

- This enables me to comfortably push off the safety holders and gives a nice smooth full range of motion during the set

- Don't go too heavy if it's your first time doing leg press - start off with no weight to get used to the machine and the safety mechanism then start to stack up weight as you see fit!

- If you're properly positioned (as above) then once you lock the machine back in its starting position you can begin calf raises without any adjustments

- This is great because you don't need to disengage the safety to do calf raises now!

- I typically leg press x3 20kg plates either side and calf raise the same!

Lateral Lunges:

- FORM FORM FORM

- I can't stress this enough for lateral lunges - form is so important

- Start legs together with the foot you're going to be stepping with SLIGHTLY in front of your back foot

- Step out so your front foot is slightly in front of your back foot, the previous step helps ensure this happens every rep

- Now, lean back with your hips keeping your core upright and solid throughout

- Imagine there's a bench behind you that you're trying to sit on

- Don't use any weight until you're 100% confident with your form!

- I do no weight because of my lower back but once you've got your form locked I recommend starting by holding a 5kg plate and working your way up!

Straight Leg Deadlift:

- Potentially the most important exercise to get your form correct

- You can see in the video how much I'm looking at the camera to ensure my form is correct

- Firstly, stand shoulder width apart and bend your knees

- Sit backwards with your hips and keep your back in a neutral position

- Don't allow your back to overextend (arch forwards) on the way down

- Stop around sock/ankle height so you don't go too far and force your back to over extend

- Pull upwards using your hamstrings and back

- I rep around the 10kg mark for these with great caution to not do my back in again!

Leg extension drop-set to finish:

- Similarly to the above leg extensions you want to position the machine so your knees are pivoting nicely off the bench

- Machine required for these as it's much faster - x2 normal sets then x1 drop set: Start at your working weight for 6 reps, drop 2 pegs for 8 reps, 2 more pegs for 10 reps and finally 2 more pegs til failure

- I'm currently doing 65kg to start with then dropping in increments of 8kg each time I drop set
