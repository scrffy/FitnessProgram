title: "Week 2 - Chest & Back"
order: 1
---
This week's chest and back session has more focus on your upper back via doing double rows (one T-bar exercise and one machine exercise). Chest is also burnt out by the amazing flat DB press superset which absolutely annihilates your pecs. Considering we're one week further into our journey I would be expecting either a slight weight increase (if you've mastered the form of each exercise) or if you're staying at the same weight then pushing for +2 reps on all exercises.

Let me know how you go!

**Incline DB**
Heavily influenced incline chest routine as I have always felt my lower chest grows faster than my upper - thus I like to focus on my upper and really go for that full look

Careful with your form picking up heavy dumbbells, I know better than most about annoying back pain caused from the gym

Bench angle determines where on your chest is activated - the higher up you go (to a certain point then it becomes majoritively shoulders) the more upper chest it works

If you're happy with where your upper chest is and you'd much rather work your entire chest then scroll down to the 'bench' section and implement dumbbell flat bench here

Form is crucial here, especially as you increase weight - careful not to go below your shoulder line on the downward part of movement

I'm currently on 40kg dumbbells for incline press, 6 reps, working my way up to 8 reps gradually!

**TBar Rows**
Form form form - don't go too heavy until you've got your form 100% down

Do not injure your back doing these, be extremely careful and if you have any doubts ask a gym employee for assistance

For similar reasons to not doing deadlifts my T-bar row weight is not that high - I'm mainly concerned about form so will max out at around two plates

Currently on 2 20kg plates and one 5 kg plate going for 12 reps per set

**Flat DB Press Superset DB Burners**
Position your arms as close as you can to mine in the video - don't flair your elbows out and don't have them touching your obliques either - go in the middle

Keep dumbbells angled at 45 degrees as I have, not straight in line with your shoulders as most people do

Bring dumbbells back down in-line with your chest, pause briefly then EXPLODE and push upwards til your elbows are locked once again

Once you've done 8 reps lock the dumbbells together (as demonstrated in the video) and go to failure with this burner set

I'm currently on roughly 25kg for this superset - any heavier and the burner set becomes nearly impossible for me!

**Cables (up & down)**
(Upward)
Killer superset, if I'm feeling frisky then I sometimes do a set of 10-15 pushups as a superset to really annihilate the chest

Position the cables at or slightly above head height

Position yourself at the centre of the machine, then step forward into the space in front and lock your legs in place

I'm then looking to find the perfect arm angle (the same angle you used on incline DB flys up above) to maximise chest gains while minimising shoulder injuries

Lock your arms in place and pull with your chest, squeezing as hard as you can as your hands touch

I do 12.5kg in downward flys for 10 reps 

(Downward)
As above, position yourself in the centre of the machine but this time don't step forward

Legs shoulder width apart, arms similar angle to above

Stick your chest out and pull up with your chest, activating it the whole way through

Squeeze at the top, 12 reps minimum and now is when I would superset with pushups if you have it in you!

I do 10.5kg for 8 reps in this direction

**Row Machine**
Essential upper back exercise to give yourself that swole look

Strict form as always, make sure to pull all the way back, PAUSE, then slowly release back to an extended arm position

Amazing point to include your dropset for today - do 3 working sets then dropset the last (4th) set baby!!

I'm currently on roughly 50kg for 10 reps\

**Bench**
Just when you think you're done for the day I hit you with flat bench press

Slow and controlled, come down to just above your chest every rep, don't bounce the bar off it but make sure you get full range of motion

If you're unsure or not confident in yourself as you're just starting out then get someone friendly in the gym to come assist/spot you!

Typically rep 70kg after a long chest session for 3-4 sets - I'm usually absolutely ruined at this stage of the workout so 4 sets is sometimes beyond me!

**Pull ups - last with final set being to failure**
Final exercise!!! x3 sets of pull ups (preferably non-assisted) but if you require assistance then that's perfectly fine too!

If you can only do a handful of reps that's totally fine too, keep at it and gradually build yourself up to 8-12 reps

Here I'm looking to pull up with the lats and back - not with your arms, get your head as high as possible and hold at the top

As many bodyweight reps as you can for 3 sets!
