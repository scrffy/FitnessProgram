Holy FKKKKK!! Congrats – you’ve made it to the end of your 8 week journey. Amazing work and I’m so impressed – you’ve absolutely annihilated it and I hope it was everything you wanted and more. 5 more days and you've completed all the scheduled workouts. However, this is only the beginning of your fitness journey. The reason I’ve labelled the routine Weeks 1 – 8 is because my fitness journey at the moment operates in roughly 8 week cycles where I do the same program, increase the weight etc. Therefore, I recommend you guys repeat the 8-week course. You can pick and choose the best bits, rearrange the order as you see fit, tailor it to your personal needs (e.g. include decline bench instead of incline, do twice as many leg days per week) – the world’s your oyster – I’ve simply given you the fitness tools required to sculpt it (and you) to what you desire!
