DB Press:

- My personal preference is the seated part of the bench slightly inclined and the back of the bench not directly upright but also slightly inclined

- This makes my movements feel a lot less restricted and puts less direct pressure on my joints

- I'm also pushing forward fairly strongly with both legs for maximum stability

- Slow, controlled movements, not letting the dumbbells come below my shoulder line

- I currently rep 30kg for 6 reps, 4 sets. Working on getting up to 10 reps before increasing weight!

Cable Lateral Raises:

- Set the cable machine at the lowest position

- Grab a handle attachment piece and latch it on

- Start on an extremely low weight so you perfect your form first

- Pull upwards with your shoulder - don't let your arm rotate and sneakily use your tri's, back or any other muscle for the raise

- Hold at the top slightly then slowly lower back down to resting position, repeat for sets of 8-12!

- I rep ~peg 3 on the cable machine, so approximately 10kg at my gym

Front & side head superset:

- My favourite superset of shoulder day

- Lateral raises: Pull up with your elbows, lock your arm angle as shown in the tutorial video, bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height but don't overextend

- Strong legs as a foundation for a great exercise

- Front raises: Slow and controlled movement, arms slightly angled, bring plate to at least head height if not higher - don't sway your movements, pull with your front delts

- I rep 12kg for lateral raises and typically do front raises with a 20kg plate

Face-Pulls:

- Amazing rear-delt exercise

- Position the cable on or very near the maximum height

- Use one of the lower weights on your opening set to ensure your form is correct

- Grip the rope at its ends and take one large step backwards with feet shoulder width apart

- Start with arms extended straight then pull in towards your head, squeezing when your hands are either side of your head

- Repeat slowly, aiming for 10-12 reps, shoulders locked in place so you're not pulling with your back

- [WEIGHT REQUIRED]

Smith Machine Press:

- Bench positioning is key - have it in the center of the bar, completely upright with enough room so the bar touches your upper chest on the way down

- Once in position add weights as you see fit

- Start with hands thumb-width away from the shiny section of the bar as you can see I have in the video

- Normal shoulder press movement, stopping when the bar is at shoulder height (slightly above chest as in video)

- I rep 10-15kg either side for 12 reps depending on how pumped I'm feeling that day!

- An amazing finisher is doing your last set (4th set) to failure so you leave the gym absolutely destroyed!
