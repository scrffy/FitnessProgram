order: 1

Right, so here's my first day of the week laid out for you. Start by watching and listening to the tutorial videos carefully. I explain everything I'm thinking/doing during the actual set which I find helps tremendously. The girl who runs the online Pilates classes I do does this during her sessions and it helps more than you can imagine. I've also provided a written description if you'd rather read it before each set. I recommend 8-12 reps, 4 sets for every exercise.

My main focus for arms is putting size on. However, I'm not looking to get enormous so I'm sure there are fitness professionals out there who may say what I'm doing isn't 100% correct by the books - but as I've already mentioned this program is simply what works for me and you guys have requested exactly that.

21's Superset:

[WARM UP]

- Start with your arms fully relaxed, then curl up to half way up your arm or a 90 degree arm-forearm angle - rep 7 times like this, then 7 in the upper half and 7 complete curls

- Form is incredibly important to ensure your bi's are constantly engaged

- Always go to failure on close grip part

- Short rest between sets, get that blood flowing

- Depending on your bicep/tricep strength I would recommend a weight ~1/3 your bodyweight

- Lock your elbows when doing your overheads, it's essential for tricep engagement

- I rep 25kg, 21 reps bicep curls, 8-10 reps overhead extensions and failure for close grip bench

Dips Superset Hammer-Curls:

(Dips)
- Definitely start these on an assisted machine.

- Start with your elbows locked and arms straight, then slowly lower yourself to 90 degrees (the forearm/upper arm angle I reach in the vid) then power back up to vertical

- Dips are amazing for both chest and triceps so you could include in your chest day too

- Don't go too far down or you'll hurt your shoulder, 90 degree bend like in the video is good

- If you can't dip your bodyweight then use the assisted machine that most gyms provide

- I do 8-12 reps of body weight dips

(Hammers)
- Lock your elbows into your obliques for best form

- Slow reps down, maximise control

- For maximum burn on any curls don't let your arms go completely vertical - this keeps your bicep engaged for the duration of your set

- Minimise body-rocking while curling for complete bicep engagement

- Start light and work your way up as form/strength improves

- Currently on 16kg for 8 reps each arm

Incline Bench Curls: 

- Start with arms vertical, slowly curl upwards until you're at the natural 'top' of the rep as in video, slow release back down

- Also great to pair with a chest exercise if you want a sneaky arm pump on chest day

- Slow and controlled is key

- Do less weight than you would normally curl, these are targeted and harder

- Lock your elbows into the bench to establish a good pivot point for your arm

- Roll shoulders back to isolate those biceps

- Keep your upper arm as vertical as you can

- I use 10-12kg dumbbells for 12 reps

Rope Pulldowns Superset Close-grip Curls:

(Rope)
- Killer superset, lock those fkn elbows!!

- Really pull OUTWARDS at the bottom of every rep to engage those tri's

- Don't let your arms come all the way up, stop roughly where I stop in the video

- These are both unreal to dropset if you're feeling frisky!

- Weight for these is highly dependant on what kind of cable machine you use. Some of them I'm ~20kg for 8 reps, others I do around 40kg

(CG Curls)
- Lock elbows as per!!

- Try minimise upper-body rocking, I know it's hard but try!

- Arms are spaced extremely close to one another, inside elbow-width apart with pinky fingers almost touching

- Close grip curls are amazing for increasing the size of the peak of your bicep - which is what we're chasing baby!

- As above, they're amazing to dropset!

- [WEIGHT]

Preacher Curls Superset Long Negatives:

- Slooooow negatives

- Good tip is to set up the chair height perfectly for you. The height that feels best for me is demonstrated in the video and it's fairly low as I like my whole upper body locked in place

- If you don't have a gym partner then do 8 exactly as I do in the video - 8 reps of normal preacher curls, 4-8 reps of slow, strong negatives

- Weight is not so important here - more important is form and how slowly you can lower the bar each time

- If you can get a friend/gym partner to resist (push down) while you try hold the negatives as long as possible this will have you both looking and feeling like superman/superwoman

- I currently do 12.5kg on either side of the bar for 8 reps then 4-6 ultra long negatives to finish each set

Overhead Tricep Extensions:

- Start low weight and work on your form

- Bring the weight all the way down stopping behind your head (be very careful NOT to overextend)

- Alternate arms with no breaks inbetween

- I'm do 10kg for overhead tricep extensions but this is limited by my minor left elbow injury, I'm sure you guys can do more!
