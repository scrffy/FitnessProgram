Week 5 means you're over the half way hump!! Congratulations for making it this far.

The next block is a repeat of Weeks 1-4 with minor modifications. It will follow the same outline with nearly the same exercises but I'll be pushing you harder. Gym results are achieved by repetition. You must repeat the same exercises (or similar enough) to achieve your goals. I've been a very similar routine to this 8 week program for nearly my entire gym career (~7 years) and it's worked for me. Sure, at times it's stagnant and you 100% need to switch it up. That's where the benefit of being part of my subscription program comes in - you guys get to chop and change the routine with me as I see fit. You'll effectively be working out with me from where ever you are in the world - how amazing is that. Our motivation for pushing through the stagnation period is results. Once you start seeing real results it will change the way you may be feeling regarding gym. As soon as I'm back into gym after a dry spell and I see my gains coming back I get ridiculously motivated. Is there anything better than that sneaky tense session in the mirror after a chest and back day? I don't think so.

Anyway, Week 5 is here and we've got gymming to get to. The differences are primarily in weight expectation as well as confidence doing the exercises. You'll now have done the same exercises multiple times over the course of the last 4-5 weeks so it's time to start upping that weight, getting your mental game down pat as you are physically doing the exercise, focussing on the individual muscle as you do both the negative and positive phases of the movement, eating right, sleeping right and training FKN HARD!!

You've come a long way since Week 1 and I gotta say your dedication and progress have been truly impressive. As we jump into Week 5, we'll continue to work on building strength and size in your arms through our amazing arms routine! By now, you should be familiar with the exercises we've been working on so it's the perfect time to start upping the fuck out of that weight! Remember, the key to success is finding that sweet spot between pushing yourself and listening to your body. As always, I recommend 8-12 reps and 4 sets for each exercise, but feel free to adjust based on your current fitness level and preferences.

I'm proud of all of you who have made it to Week 5. Stay focused, push yourself a little harder, and remember that progress comes from consistency and effort.

In Week 5, we'll continue to target your chest and back with challenging movements designed to help you achieve that full, sculpted look you desire. The goal is to build strength and definition in these key muscle groups, so expect a high-intensity and efficient workout. There's a strong overlap with Week 1's exercises but as I've mentioned many times before repitition is key here. You must consistently repeat the same exercises to get that body you've been dreaming about.

Week 5 leg day is a journey on its own. Lock in and grind. Dig deep, find that motivation and go smash your legs.

As for Cardio Day - the program rotation brings us back to our swim. Our cardio is categorised as one 'easy' week and one 'hard' week. In Week 1, we swam 800m - this week we'll increase that. I'm in control of this up to the pilates day then it's entirely up to you guys which of her workouts you select.

For our swim, we're adding 200m overall taking you up to 1km! So 8 more laps in total, snuck in throughout your routine. If you get your head down and lock in I guarantee you'll barely notice the extra laps.

If you've opted for an alternative this week then go for it, I've increased the difficulty on the HIIT program for this round so that should be just as challenging for all those of you electing not to swim.
