You know the drill...IT'S WEEK 4 AND TIME TO GRIND 

At the end of this week you'll be half way through, look at you go - annihilating it! Week 4's focus is STRENGTH - so we're lowering the reps and increasing the weight throughout. The swim session will be harder and will require more effort on your end than Week 1's which is to be expected as you're now all seasoned fitness experts!

As with all previous weeks comprehensive exercise guidance is provided in the Tutorial Video for each workout, additional description is provided in the side bar next to the video.

Week 4, someone's gotta do it!

Considering it's strength week I've subbed out some targeted exercises for more strength-orientated ones (e.g. subbed out isolated seated curls for preacher curls). Try increase (even by the smallest amount) the weight you did last week for the core movements. I understand it may be too early but perhaps your form is better this time round and the movements feel more natural. If so, chuck some hype music on and bump that shit up!!!!

For all your other days this week, rep-expectation is reduced to minimum 6, maximum 8. If you're getting 8 without struggling then you're going too light - up that shit!

Leg day for the fourth time round - how are you feeling by now? Nice and rested? Ready to annihilate your legs? Today we're going heavier than usual on all exercises so you know the drill - less reps! Again, you'll notice that lateral lunges have been swapped for heavy leg extension machine. This is because I find the lateral lunges much harder to increase weight on. Also, I love smashing my quads so if I'm being honest it was an easy swap ;)

Stay motivated, stay hungry - LET'S MAKE SOME GAINS!

My cardio recommendations don't change week to week - you just need to hold yourself accountable and make sure you're completing SOME form of cardio. I don't mind how you choose to do so, it could be a hike with friends, the stair machine at the gym, laps of a pool or a local sport - it's entirely up to you.

Last week we focussed on a , this week the main event is a HIIT workout. As always, alternatives are provided beneath.

Let's get into it!!
