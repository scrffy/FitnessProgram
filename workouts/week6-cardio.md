Week 6: HIIT Workout

- [ITEMS REQUIRED]: Water bottle, phone (timer), markers (I use my hat and a water bottle)

- Go to your local park (if weather permits) and do the following:

- Warm-up:

- Light jog around the park (roughly 3-5 mins)

- Bodyweight squats, arm circles, any stretching you want to include

Workout:

- [Place markers 30m apart, do all your exercises at one marker and use the other as your point of reference for sprints]

- I place my water bottle where I am and hat (or other item) at ~30m away

- x15 push-ups

- x15 jump-squats [Normal body weight squats - jump at the top]

- x25 mountain climbers [lie in a plank position and raise your knee to your chest, repeat 20 times (10 per leg) at a rapid pace]

- x1 30m sprint, 30m jog back to starting position

- 45 second rest

REPEAT 3 TIMES

- x15 burpees [basically a push-up superset with a jump-squat]

- x25 body-weight squats

- Lunge 30m (to your reference point)

- Sprint back

- 60 second rest

- REPEAT 3 TIMES

Cool-down:

- Go for a well-deserved walk/lap around the park. I like to listen to relaxing music, walk slowly and enjoy mother nature before heading home - well done!!


Alternatives:

600m Swim:

- Again, this is not professional fitness advice it's simply what I typically do for cardio and it works for me!

- I like swimming in particular as it's cardio but still builds and maintains muscle. It hits delts (shoulders), lats (back), traps, tri's & bi's, abs, quads, hamstrings, calves and hip flexors!

- Basically hits your entire body while being amazing for your cardiovascular system too!

This week's swim workout is:

- x4 freestyle lengths (up and back in a 25m pool) without stopping

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 30 second rest

- 1 slow length up then immediately 1 length back as fast as you can

- 60 second rest

Repeat 3 times

Online Pilates:

- I recommend Move With Nicole on Youtube:

- [MoveWithNicole](https://www.youtube.com/@MoveWithNicole)

- She has great workouts for the whole body, legs, abs, upper body, lower body and stretching - I like to try incorporate minimum one workout per week

Fitness Class:

- Highly recommend Barry's Bootcamp - if there's one near you and within your budget then get in touch and see what they have to offer you!

- If not, then your local gym probably offers similar classes - enquire as you see fit as they're an awesome cardio workout!
