**WEEK 2 BABYYYY let's get it!**

Congratulations on making it through Week 1 - I hope it was everything you wanted and more. Also, I hope you're just as excited as me for week 2. As I'm sure you'll realise there are exercises that overlap with week 1. This is done on purpose and is not laziness on my end. You need your main exercises (bench, deadlifts, squats, shoulder press, 21's superset) to grow in the gym and every gym-goer will tell you how essential it is that you incorporate these into your weekly split.

As with Week 1 comprehensive exercise guidance is provided in the Tutorial Video for each workout, additional description is provided in the side bar next to the video.

Week 2 is an essential motivation week. I understand that some days may be tougher than others - and a lot of people find these tough days popping up during the second week of consecutive training. You've given the first week everything you've got and now it's time to restart. On such days, remember why you started, why you purchased this program. Remember your fitness goals and go one step further - visualise the version of yourself you're training to become. Also, keep in mind that you're not alone in this journey. Reach out to me at any time, especially when you're feeling unmotivated. Also, take care of yourself inside and outside of the gym. Get enough rest, fuel your body with nutritious food and stay hydrated. All these factors play important roles in your fitness journey as they ensure longevity.

Ok - now the boring stuff's out of the way - let's gym!!

# Warm-Ups
 Warming up is one of the most important parts of working out. It prevents injury and ensures you will be able to work out for many years to come.

With upper body, I find the most crucial warm up to be your rotator cuff exercises.

Your rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons in your shoulders that allow your shoulders to rotate.

It is fundamental for nearly all upper body exercises - healthy shoulders are so important for a long and prosperous gym career

Stretching is a requirement regardless of the day you're doing - obviously you'll be stretching different muscles for different days at the gym.
